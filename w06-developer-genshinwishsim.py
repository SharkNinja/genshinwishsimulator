"""Genshin Impact Wish Simulator"""
# Gensin Impact is a gacha game, where in the game you have to roll
# for various characters and weapons. This simulator is meant to
# test your luck as if you were rolling on the actual game. 
# You can use this simulator if you do not play the game, or to
# tese your luck if you do not wish to waste your primogems (the in game currency used to roll)

"""Requirements"""
#✔️ The program may be any type of game or interactive SIMULATION.
#✔️ The program should use classes and instances.
#✔️ The program should apply the four principles of programming with classes.
#✔️ The program should use the libraries chosen in the course.
#✔️ The program should be delivered through a version control system.
#✔️ The program should be able to be run from the command line.
